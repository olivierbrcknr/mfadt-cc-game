# The Legend Of Lamp

This is my midterm project for the class Critical Computation at the [MFA Design & Technology](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-design-technology/) program at Parsons School of Design. Find my class specific portfolio [→ here](https://mfadt-cc-olivierbrcknr.glitch.me/p7.html).

It represents my journey through (some of) the different rooms of my life up until, hopefully, the move to New York City.

This class was held by [Xin Xin](https://xin-xin.info/) and [Katherine Moriwaki](http://www.kakirine.com/). The lab was instructed by [Elena Gold](https://elenalee.gold/) and [Jon Packles](http://jonpackles.com/).

## Code

This project has been built with the [p5](https://p5js.org/) framework. I also want to mention that I heavily relied on the collision detection explanations provided by [Jeffrey Thompson](http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/).

Find the complete code in the [completeGame.js](completeGame.js) file. Or you can find the same project in the [p5 editor](https://editor.p5js.org/olivierbrcknr/sketches/QhgZUzyng).

The gray boxed code is backed up [here](grayboxing.js) and playable [here](https://editor.p5js.org/olivierbrcknr/sketches/wnumzIGtV). The same goes for the [game engine code](engineVisualization.js) and [its experience](https://editor.p5js.org/olivierbrcknr/sketches/GcBeUCFrz).

## Styling

The game uses the font [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) by CodeMan38.

## Sound

For the sound effects, I used the sounds from *The Legend Of Zelda — A Link To The Past* from [this library](https://www.sounds-resource.com/snes/legendofzeldaalinktothepast/sound/7573/). The [music](music) is done by my friends Hans and Fabian, who I am really grateful for this contribution! (Also I just want to mention that I totally can recommend their music projects [Poly Poly](https://wearepolypoly.com/) and [C.O.W. 牛](http://www.cowcowcowcow.com/)!)


## Next Steps

I might continue to develop this game further. Here are some points I am currently thinking about to evolve:

- [ ] Adding more levels (other, minor, room changes I did not consider so far due to the sheer amount of levels)
- [ ] Making some objects movable, e.g. the shoes in the Hamburg level, to increase the complexity
- [ ] Having some objects constantly moving and thereby changing the cable length and thus pulling the lamp back
- [ ] Thinking about different issues with the cable, e.g. disabling that the lamp can cross the cable
- [ ] Or the contrary to the point above, having specific objects that need to be wrapped by the cable to enable reaching the goal
